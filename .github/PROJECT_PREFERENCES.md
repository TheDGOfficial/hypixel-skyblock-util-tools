### Some information about files and folders

- The files under .github folder are GitHub-specific files for GitHub.
- The files under src are the source files for the project.
- Files starting with "." in the main folder are normally hidden files, mainly for Git configuration.
- Files named with a full uppercase letter in the main folder are also for GitHub.
- The files or folders under src/test are excluded, and they are for tests only.
- The files in the src/resources folder are automatically added to built binary.
