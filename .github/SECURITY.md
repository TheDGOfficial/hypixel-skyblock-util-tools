## Supported Versions

| Version                                                          | Supported               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Latest GitHub release                                            | :white_check_mark:      |
| Default branch, nightly builds, development/alpha/beta releases* | :ballot_box_with_check: |
| Other branches or forked versions                                | :x:                     |

*Official Nightly Builds by GitHub Actions are supported. However, they might not be stable and any issues with them can
be delayed just before a stable GitHub release. Development/Alpha/Beta releases from GitHub Releases (those marked as "
pre-releases") are also supported, but only if there is no stable release succeeding them.

We may also provide support to self-builds of default branch, i.e. when build fails on a specific OS (that is supported by the project).
